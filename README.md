# Rossmann Store Sales Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Rossmann store sales data to uncover patterns and factors affecting sales performance. Using Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the analysis provides actionable insights into sales trends, promotional impacts, and holiday effects.

## Data Description
**Dataset:** [Rossmann Store Sales Data](link-to-dataset)

**Columns:**
- `Store`: Store identifier
- `Sales`: Daily sales (in Euros)
- `Customers`: Number of customers
- `Open`: Whether the store was open (0 = Closed, 1 = Open)

- `SchoolHoliday`: Whether it was a school holiday (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- Additional columns with store-specific information

## Analysis
- **Sales Trends:** Analyzed how sales vary by day of the week and over time. Visualized sales trends to identify peak sales periods.
- **Promotional Impact:** Evaluated the effect of promotional activities on sales performance. Compared sales with and without promotions.
- **Holiday Effects:** Investigated sales patterns during state and school holidays. Identified significant variations in sales during holidays.

## Key Insights
- **Sales Trends:** Identified days with the highest and lowest sales.
- **Promotional Impact:** Assessed the effectiveness of promotions on boosting sales.
- **Holiday Effects:** Analyzed the impact of different types of holidays on sales.
